## v1.2.X Update

v1.2.X update is a rework of the sin-sheet, adjustments to the player character sheet and addition of globaltalismans linked to tiles in game. 

This update has features included but not limited too:
- Trauma Questions can now be checked off and are now sorted out line by line on the sheet of the sin
- Sins fields have all been updated to smart text boxes for better customization and edits.
- Sins Now have 6 Quick Action buttons to automate several player interactions (More to be added in future updates)
- Talismans can now be seen on Sin Sheet directly if you want to link them.
- Sins now have expanded views of severe attack and can add your own questions for extra fun!
- Sin page formatting improved.
- Players stats are now shown as bubbles and not numbers. Stats were added to localization document. (Further work needed)
- Talismans can now be put inside of the scene and can be edited as such.
- Fixed Spelling Errors on Hound.
- Fixed Spelling Errors in Homebrew.

## v1.1.X Update

Version 1.1.X update is a rework of the item sheet, blasphemies, agendas, sin-marks, and afflictions. All of these items have now been itemized, and we are able to further update better automation into the system moving forward. 

Features are included but not limited too: 

- Re-work of sheet aesthetics to better fit accessibility needs.
- Re-coloring and re-designing the look of blasphmies, as well as letting you customize your own
- Kit has been re-styled and icons have been updated.
- Homebrew page for Agenda and blasphemies for easy to create home-brew content.
- Afflictions are now items, and afflictions can now be added onto sheet by dragging them on.
- Sin-mark re-haul, automatic sin-mark rolling, and improved sin-mark roll system.
- Agendas are now semi-automated. You drag an agenda onto sheet, it will automate the process of adding in agenda items.
- Blasphmies are now semi-automated, You drag blasphmies onto your sheet and it will automate the process of adding in abilities etc.
- XP managment has been vastly improved with automated xp advancment, xp maximum increase and decrease, and end of session XP bonuses.
- Added in some settings for player managment to be more accessible.


## Migrating to v1.1.X 

If you are coming from an older version of the system here is what you have to know:
We have completley re-worked items, and they are **Mandatory** for the new system work. Details are below when importing the new items, and remember **KEEP DOCUMENT IDS**
When updating, I highly, highly suggest deleting all of your old items and adding the new ones. 
In addition to this, you may have to wipe some parts of actor-sheets.
I would take screenshots of what you had before and replicate them back to the now standard items that are needed. 

Things that will most definitley  be wiped off your old character sheets are:
------------------
1. Agendas
2. Blasphemies
3. Sin Marks
4. Afflictions


Overall, the rest of your game should be un-changed on the game-master side. 

As a side note, it will definitley be in a 1.2.X update where we re-haul sins and improve functionality. This may not be for some time as we perfect the player portion of the game. 
If you have any questions, message in the foundry vtt channel. Thank you!
